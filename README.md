Different C# coding projects starting from basics all the way to my BlackJack console game that I created using C# in dotNet which demonstrates my skills using C#.

- Car Insurance
- TwentyOne (BlackJack) Console Game


<h3>Car Insurance</h3
  This project is an MVC Web Application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
    
<h3>TwentyOne Game</h3>
This project is a fully functional BlackJack Console Game that demonstrates a lot of important aspects of C# and object oriented programming. Give it a try, I promise it will be fun.
