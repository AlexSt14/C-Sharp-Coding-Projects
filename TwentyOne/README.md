PLEASE NOTE That this program is using the StreamWriter command to create a log file (Just for the purpose of demonstrating C# Features) that will log with time stamp each card type that was given to the player! Please make sure to change the directory of the StreamWriter in case partition D is not available on your computer.

"StreamWriter(@"D:\log.txt", true)"
